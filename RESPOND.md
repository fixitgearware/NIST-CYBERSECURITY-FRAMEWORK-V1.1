<h2>Reference Guide in Planning Organizations Risk Management.</h2>

<br>

<h2>Respond</h2> function guides the active steps needed to be taken  when a cybersecurity incident is detected.

Below is listed the various Sub-categories of the <strong>"Respond"</strong> function, and how they can be implemented in planning the organization's risk assesment, to counter a cybersecurity incident.

<td><strong>Response Planning</strong></td><td><strong>RS.RP</strong></td><td><strong>Response to Cybersecurity Events:  </strong><br>  It should indicate on how response processes and procedures should be carried out, and maintained. This to ensure a timely response, when cybersecurity events (Breach, Malware on the network, e.t.c) are detected.  
</td><td><strong>RS.RP-1 </strong></td><td><strong>RS.RP-1:</strong>The response plan is executed during  or after an event (Incidence Occurence).      <br>

<td><strong>Communications</strong></td><td><strong>RS.CO</strong></td><td><strong>Coordinating Response with the Organization Team and Government Agencies: </strong><br> Organizations response to activities are to be coordinated with Internal and external stakeholders, in an appropriate manner. Also external support from law enforcement agencies (CIA, FBI, Police, e.t.c.,)
</td><td><strong>RS.CO-1, RS.CO-2, RS.CO-3, RS.CO-4, RS.CO-5 </strong></td><td><strong>RS.CO-1:</strong> Personnels are to be informed of their roles and order of operations when a response is needed.    <br><strong>RS.CO-2:</strong>Events are consistently reported, while ensuring the adherence to laid down criterias.                                  <br><strong> RS.CO-3:</strong> Information are to be shared consistently with response plan.                                           <br><strong>RS.CO-4:</strong> All coordination with stakeholders, should occur consistently with response plans.     <br>                                                                                              <strong> RS.CO-5:</strong>  Voluntary threat intelligence sharing is undertaken with external stakeholders to enhance overall cybersecurity situational awareness.   <br>

</td><td><strong>RS.AN-1, RS.AN-2, RS.AN-3, RS.AN-4 </strong></td><td><strong>RS.AN-1:</strong> All Notifications from detection systems  (IDS, IPS, Honeypot e.t.c) are investigated.        <br><strong> RS.AN-2:</strong> Incident Level of IMPACT, should be properly understood.                                  <br><strong> RS.AN-3:</strong>  Forensics (Incident first responder, Investigations, e.t.c,) are conducted.                                                                                        <br><strong>RS.AN-4: </strong>  Categorizing of incidence should be consistent and Align with response plans.
