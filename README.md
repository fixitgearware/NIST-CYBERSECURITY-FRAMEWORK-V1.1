<br>
The <a href="https://www.fixitgearware.com/cybsec-news/cyber-security/the-nist-cyber-security-framework/2023/09/07/">NIST Cyber Security framework (V1.1)</a>, originated from the United States of America's concern for its national and economic security, which heavily relies on the functioning of critical infrastructures. <br>To ensure the resilience and longevity of these infrastructures, Barack Obama, who was the President of the United States at the time, issued <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/publication/executive-orders-13636-and-13691-privacy-and-civil-liberties-assessment-reports#:~:text=Executive%20Order%2013636%2C%20Improving%20Critical,neutral%20cybersecurity%20framework%2C%20and%20to">Executive Order 13636 (EO) (Executive Orders 13636 and 13691 Privacy and Civil Liberties Assessment Reports)</a>, titled <strong>“Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity”</strong> on February 12th, 2013.<br><br>

This executive order initiated the voluntary development of a Cybersecurity Framework. This framework offers a <strong>“prioritized, flexible, repeatable, performance-based, and cost-effective approach,”</strong> assisting organizations that use critical infrastructure services in managing cybersecurity risk.
<br><br>
Below is a brief summary of this framework's functions. For a detailed view of the various functions and their applications in planning your organization's risk assessment, please follow the corresponding Github repository link for each function.<br><br>

<table>
<tr>
<td><strong>FUNCTION</strong></td><td><strong>ID</strong></td><td><strong>BRIEF EXPLANATION</strong></td><td><strong>CATEGORIES</strong></td><td><strong>RESOURCE URL</strong></td>
</tr>




<td> IDENTIFY</td><td> ID </td><td> The NIST Cybersecurity Framework's <strong>"IDENTIFY" </strong> function plays a crucial role in comprehending an organization's cybersecurity risk management for its assets, which include personnel, systems, data, and functions.<br>
 This function provides a deep understanding of the organization's business environment and the risks involved. Consequently, it enables the organization to devise a well-structured action plan and prioritize its efforts in line with its risk management strategy and business requirements. </td><td> &#x2022; Asset Management <br><strong>(ID.AM)</strong><br><br> &#x2022; Business Environment <br><strong>(ID.BE)</strong><br> <br> &#x2022; Governance<br><strong>(ID.GV)</strong><br><br> &#x2022; Risk Assessment <br><strong>(ID.RA)</strong><br><br> &#x2022; Risk Management Strategy <br><strong>(ID.RM)</strong><br></td><td>&#x2022; <strong>Website :</strong><br><a href="https://www.fixitgearware.com/cybsec-news/cyber-security/the-nist-framework-cheatsheet-for-identify/2023/09/11/" target="_blank">Identify Function.</a><br><br>&#x2022; <strong>GitHub<br>:</strong><a href="https://github.com/fixitgearware/NIST-CYBERSECURITY-FRAMEWORK-V1.1/blob/main/IDENTIFY.md" target="_blank">Repository</a></td>
</tr>



<td> PROTECT </td><td> PR </td><td>The <strong>"Protect"</strong> function of the NIST Cybersecurity Framework actively develops and implements relevant security measures to ensure the delivery and functionality of critical services (Infrastructures). <br>
This function involves the implementation of security controls with the primary goal of protecting classified and private information, as well as business-critical systems, thereby mitigating risks. By doing so, it contains the potential impact of a cybersecurity breach or attack. </td><td> &#x2022; Access Control<br><strong>(PR.AC)</strong><br><br> &#x2022; Awareness & Training <br><strong>(PR.AT)</strong><br> <br> &#x2022; Data Security <br><strong>(PR.DS)</strong><br><br> &#x2022; Information Protection, Processes, and Procedures <br><strong>(PR.IP)</strong><br><br> &#x2022; Maintenance<br><strong>(PR.MA)</strong><br><br>&#x2022; Protective Technology<br><strong>(PR.PT)</strong></td><td>&#x2022; <strong>Website :</strong><br><a href="https://www.fixitgearware.com/cybsec-news/cyber-security/part2-the-nist-framework-cheatsheet-for-protect/2023/10/03/" target="_blank">Protect Function.</a><br><br>&#x2022; <strong>GitHub <br>:</strong><a href="https://github.com/fixitgearware/NIST-CYBERSECURITY-FRAMEWORK-V1.1/blob/main/PROTECT.md" target="_blank">Repository</a></td>
</tr>



<td> DETECT </td><td> DE </td><td>The <strong>"Detect"</strong> function of the NIST Framework actively develops and implements suitable security measures and principles to spot any cybersecurity breaches or incidents.<br> Its main goal is to enable the organization to promptly detect any unusual activity on its systems or network and comprehend its potential impact.  </td><td>&#x2022; Anomalies and Events <br><strong>(DE.AE)</strong><br><br> &#x2022; Security Continuous Monitoring <br><strong>(DE.CM)</strong><br> <br> &#x2022; Detection Processes <br><strong>(DE.DP)</strong></td><td>&#x2022; <strong>Website :</strong><br><a href="https://www.fixitgearware.com/cybsec-news/cyber-security/part3-the-nist-framework-cheatsheet-for-detect/2023/10/04/" target="_blank">Detect Function.</a><br><br> &#x2022;<strong>GitHub <br>:</strong><a href="https://github.com/fixitgearware/NIST-CYBERSECURITY-FRAMEWORK-V1.1/blob/main/DETECT.md" target="_blank">Repository</a></td>
</tr>


<td> RESPOND </td><td> RS </td><td>The <strong>"Respond"</strong> function, a core feature of the NIST Cybersecurity Framework, actively guides the necessary steps to take when a cybersecurity incident is detected. The actions taken shape the response and determine the potential impact level of a cybersecurity incident.  </td><td>&#x2022; Response Planning <br><strong>(RS.RP)</strong><br><br> &#x2022; Communications <br><strong>(RS.CO)</strong><br> <br> &#x2022; Analysis <br><strong>(RS.AN)</strong><br><br> &#x2022; Mitigations <br><strong>(RS.MI)</strong><br><br> &#x2022; Improvements <br><strong>(RS.IM)</strong><br></td></td><td>&#x2022; <strong>Website :</strong><br><a href="https://www.fixitgearware.com/cybsec-news/cyber-security/part4-the-nist-framework-cheatsheet-for-respond/2023/10/05/" target="_blank">Respond Function.</a><br><br>&#x2022;<strong>GitHub <br>:</strong><a href="https://github.com/fixitgearware/NIST-CYBERSECURITY-FRAMEWORK-V1.1/blob/main/RESPOND.md" target="_blank">Repository</a></td>
</tr>


<td> RECOVER </td><td> RC </td><td>The NIST Cybersecurity Framework's <strong>"Recover"</strong> function emphasizes the need to create and execute essential activities that maintain resilience, restore functions, and services affected by a cybersecurity event. <br>
This function should facilitate a swift return to regular business operations after cybersecurity incidents, minimizing the organization's impact. It accentuates the need to address existing threats with practical solutions, rather than relying solely on defense.
