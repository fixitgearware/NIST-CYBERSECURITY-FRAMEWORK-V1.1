<h2>Reference Guide in Planning Organizations Risk Management.</h2>


<br>

<h2>Protect</h2> function helps you in developing and implementing relevant security measures to ensure the delivery and functionality of your organization's critical services (Infrastructures).

Below is listed the various Sub-categories of the <strong>"Protect"</strong> and how you can plan your organization's risk assesment in safeguarding its critical infrastructure and sensitive information.
